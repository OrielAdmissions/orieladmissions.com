        <x-accordion heading="When should my student start working with a college counselor?">
            <p class="mb-4">
                The earlier that you begin your engagement with Oriel Admissions, the greater impact that we can have on
                your child’s admissions chances. A student’s curriculum in middle school will often determine their
                academic profile in high school. Starting as early as 8th grade can allow us to set your student on the
                path for academic success. </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                For our long-term counseling engagements, we create a Strategic Roadmap that is personalized to each
                student and is designed to provide guidance for how a student spends their time in high school. We can
                build this roadmap for our students as early as 8th grade up to as late as the first portion of 11th
                grade. </p>
            <p>
                However, we can also support students in the later stages of their high school experience and often
                engage with students who are rising into their senior year or who may need assistance improving their
                applications while in their senior year. </p>
        </x-accordion>

        <x-accordion heading="What does a Strategic Roadmap typically include?">
            <p class="mb-4">
                The Strategic Roadmap combines academic planning with extracurricular and leadership development and we
                create them when we begin working with students between 8th grade and 10th grade or in early 11th grade.
                All Strategic Roadmaps are completely personalized to the student and no two are alike! </p>
            <p>
                The Strategic Roadmap will take into consideration the academic trajectory of a student and where they
                might need to double up on coursework or build new academic skill sets. The extracurricular and
                leadership development portion of the roadmap will provide guidance on the numerous ways in which a
                student may explore their budding interests and will make suggestions for finding meaningful ways to
                develop those passions and to make an impact in their community. </p>
        </x-accordion>

        <x-accordion heading="What does your 360-degree approach mean?">
            <p class="mb-4">
                Our unique 360-degree approach to counseling is how we provide students and families with the most
                comprehensive level of support, allowing students to develop the skills that they need to be successful
                in high school, in college, and beyond. </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                The student will have a primary college counselor who will meet with them on a regular basis for
                advising sessions (8th, 9th and 10th grade) or who will work directly with them on their application
                (11th and 12th grade). </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                In addition to their college counselor, the student will be supported by academic tutors, SAT/ACT
                tutors, a career coach, a writing coach, and project mentors, as needed. </p>
            <p>
                Rona Aydin, the founder of Oriel Admissions, is involved with every family as well. Rona will meet
                quarterly with the student to check on their progress and is always available to provide support and
                strategic direction as needed. </p>

        <x-accordion heading="Will my child work with the same counselor during the entire process?">
            <p class="mb-4">
                All students will have a primary college counselor as well as a team of professionals available to
                support them. The Oriel Admissions team includes SAT and ACT tutors, academic tutors, career coaches,
                project mentors, and writing coaches who will work with students to build a holistic set of skills.
                Oriel Admissions goes above and beyond to ensure that each student is paired with a college counselor
                who aligns with their unique needs. If a student ever feels the need for a different fit, the team is
                committed to facilitating a seamless transition to another counselor. The same is applicable for the
                other members of the Oriel Admissions team. </p>
        </x-accordion>

        <x-accordion heading="How many students do your counselors work with?">
            <p>
                Our counselors intentionally limit the number of students they work with to ensure each student receives
                the highest level of personalized support. A counselor will only take on a new student if they have
                sufficient time in their schedule and will refrain from accepting additional students once their
                capacity is reached. </p>
        </x-accordion>

        <x-accordion heading="How is Oriel Admissions different from other college counseling firms?">

                deeply about building relationships and we keep in touch with many of our clients, even after they have

            <p class="mb-4">Our approach to college counseling mirrors the holistic nature of the application evaluation process. We
                want students to build a wide range of skills so that they are better prepared to succeed in high
                school, in college, and beyond. With our full suite of services, we are well equipped to help students
                excel throughout their educational journeys.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">For students targeting selective colleges, students are expected to dive deep into a field of interest
                and we specialize in finding ways for students to stand out. We advise on pursuing entrepreneurial
                projects, passion projects, self-directed research, finding internships, and other unique

        <x-accordion heading="What geographic regions do your students come from?">
            <p class="mb-4">
                Our students come from all over the country and from all around the world. Our students attend public
                high schools, charter high schools, and private high schools. Additionally, we are well versed in the
                educational systems of the countries that commonly send their students to study in the US.

            </p>
            <p>Even if we have not worked with a student from your district before, we will quickly familiarize
                ourselves with your school and what makes it unique. After all, there are over 20,000 institutions
                providing a high school education in the US and we have not yet had the opportunity to work with
                students from all of them! </p>
        </x-accordion>

        <x-accordion heading="What subjects do your students plan to major in?">
            <p class="mb-4">
                We guide students with diverse academic backgrounds. Our students are incredibly diverse in their
                interests and passions. They are creative thinkers, aspiring designers, and artists eager to explore
                innovative fields. Many of our students are drawn to the humanities, seeking a broad and
                interdisciplinary education that fosters critical thinking and a deeper understanding of the world
                around them. We also work with students who are passionate about STEM subjects and are driven to build
                quantitative skills in fields like engineering, computer science, and medicine.

            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">What sets many of our students apart is their desire to pursue dual interests. We encourage them to use
                their time in high school to explore these parallel passions, crafting a unique academic narrative that
                reflects their individuality. </p>
            <p>Our students apply to a wide variety of colleges and programs. From Ivy League universities and small
                liberal arts colleges to large public flagship institutions, they seek out schools that align with their
                goals and aspirations. They apply to specialized programs such as arts and design schools, engineering
                and computer science departments, business programs, and even competitive BS/MD programs. No matter the
                path, we help our students present their best selves and achieve success across a broad spectrum of
                academic disciplines. </p>
        </x-accordion>

        <x-accordion heading="What colleges do your students apply to?">
            <p class="mb-4">
                Our students apply to every imaginable college in the US, Canada, the UK, and other countries throughout
                the world. Many of our students are targeting Ivy League and other highly selective colleges. We are
                equally prepared to support students with diverse goals and college preferences, tailoring our guidance
                to meet their unique aspirations. </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                We recognize that no two students are the same, and we are equally prepared to support those pursuing a
                variety of goals and college preferences. Our team tailors guidance to each student's unique
                aspirations, ensuring they find the best-fit schools where they will thrive both academically and
                personally.

                accommodate their schedules and academic calendars, ensuring they can start their research journey when

                Completing the Oriel Ignite Research Program provides students with valuable research experience, skills
                that colleges are increasingly looking for in applicants. Completing research demonstrates intellectual
                curiosity, initiative, and the ability to engage deeply with a topic of interest, which are all
                qualities that stand out in the admissions process. The program also allows students to develop academic
                literature review skills, critical thinking and analysis skills, and computer programming skills (either
                in R or Python). </p>
        </x-accordion>

        <x-accordion heading="How are students matched with their mentor?">
            <p>
                Students are matched with their mentor based on mutual interests and areas of academic focus. We take
                the time to understand each student’s passions and goals, then pair them with a mentor who has expertise
                in that particular field. This personalized matching process ensures that students work with mentors who
                can provide meaningful guidance and help them explore their chosen topic in depth. </p>
        </x-accordion>

        <x-accordion heading="What is the time commitment required for the Oriel Ignite Research Program?">
            <p>
                The Oriel Ignite Research Program requires a one-hour virtual meeting with a mentor each week, during
                which students receive guidance on their project. In addition to these meetings, students are expected
                to dedicate several hours of independent work each week to complete tasks discussed during the
                mentorship meetings. </p>

                Outside of college counseling, Oriel Admissions works with applicants to Masters programs in a variety
                of fields. We have worked with applicants to apply to Masters programs in real estate, computer science,
                public policy, finance, management, data analytics, as well as many others. We regularly assist

                our MBA clients here and on Poets and Quants. </p>
        </x-accordion>

        <x-accordion heading="Do you provide pro bono services?">
            <p>
                Our counselors are committed to giving back by offering their expertise through pro bono counseling
                opportunities. Many of our counselors volunteer their time with programs like the Matchlighters Scholars
                Program and local Community-Based Organizations. While we actively support these efforts, we do not
                currently have a pro bono program through Oriel Admissions. </p>
